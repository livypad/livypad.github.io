# “如意”

## 中文

“万事如意”其实可以有两种实现方式：可以是提出心意之后即时实现；也可以是提前预知会被提出的心意并提前准备好。后一种方式时间更加宽松，对“灯神”能力需求可以降低。只要分支预测准确率足够高，提前准备带来的优势应该是可以超过偶发的预测失败以及维护一个预测器的额外代价（重新即时准备，旧的准备浪费）。所以说，“万事如意”的“灯神“不一定是神通广大，可能只是你太容易被 ta 理解。

## English

In fact, "as you wish“ can be accomplished in two different strategies, a genie can either fulfill ones' dream or wish after its proposal, or it can predict that particular wish and prepare for it in advance. The latter strategy has a much looser time constraint on genie, therefore requiring less magic power. As long as branch predictor's accuracy is high enough, the advantage of prediction might outweigh the extra cost of maintaining the predictor and penalty of misprediction (former preparation becomes useless and the wish need to be fulfilled instantly). To draw a conclusion, a genie who promise to follow any order may not be extremely resourceful, instead, maybe you are too easy to understand and to be predicted.
